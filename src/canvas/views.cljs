;; Use (-> ctx 
;;         (.method args))
;; Canvas methods :
;; .fillRect takes 4 args top left width height => rectangle
;; -- problems some rect are filled and some are not, but I cant 
;; -- see how to tell in data
;; .arc takes 4 args center-top center-left radius 
;; start-angle end-angle in radians (0 and 2Ï€ for a full circle)
;; ---how to tell if it is full or just the border?
;; ctx.arc(100, 75, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
;; .fillStyle takes one arg a color
;; this gives me all but the group. I will put it either in the 
;; :key (str (:group) "-"(get-index)) => :key 0-23, or
;; put all elements in app-db and subscribe to the group

;; If I run (map draw-element d/data) it should draw all the elements,
;; the repl returns nil, as it should.
;; but nothing is rendered. 
;; I think the problem is that for some reason I am supper zoomed in 
;; on the canvas, but I dont know why and I can't find any info.
;; the border of the images are very blury, which supports the idea 
;; of being zoomed in, as does the fact that the pixel values are not rendred
;; in "view port" pixels but un some thing larger.

;; I have spent most of my time with this bug. But I just saw the time, and
;; it has been over two hours.

;; I initially had the canvas in the main-panel in this ns, but since I needed it
;; to load before I define canvas and ctx so I set it up temporarily
;; on index.html the bug was there before the move.
;; 

;; the more I increase the width and height of the canvas, 
;; the more zommed out I am. It is like it keeps the original 
;; 300px by 150px size contained in the defined height and width

;; if I set! the values after the fact, it seems to break

;; but I will stop now.
